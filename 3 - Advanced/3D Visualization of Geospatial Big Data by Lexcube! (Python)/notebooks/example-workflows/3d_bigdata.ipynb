    "## 📂 Data Cube with Random Numbers\n",
    "To create a cubic dataset with random numbers, we will import numpy, xarray, zarr, and pandas libraries. We will generate 720 latitudes from -90 to +90, 1440 longitudes from -180 to +180, and 365 days from 2023–01–01 to 2023–12–31. Next, we will create a 3D array with random numbers ranging from -20 to 30 and set time, latitude, and longitude. After that, we will convert the array to Xarray, save it in Zarr format, and label the data as \"air temperature\". The following lines do these steps for you:"

    "Data visualization nowadays is a great skill that can help us tell stories and efficiently present the outcomes in our reports. Lexcube is one of the libraries in this field that helps us visualize data cubes, particularly 3D geospatial databases, quickly and in a visually engaging way. In this post, we cover how to prepare your datasets for this library and how to use it for your data visualization projects. Specifically, we created two datasets: one based on completely random numbers and the second based on air temperature reported by climate databases. Additional sources are provided if you want to create your data cube for any location and time frame."
