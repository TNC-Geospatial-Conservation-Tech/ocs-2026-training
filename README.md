# Spatial Data Science Virtual Training 2026
Welcome to the official github repository for our 2026 spatial data science virtual training, sponsored by One Conservancy Science at TNC. This training is structured in three modules: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced.

Scientists at TNC and beyond are increasingly meeting conservation needs by leveraging scalable cloud-native compute resources in their spatial data science and modeling workflows. Spatial data science encompasses a wide world of tools, techniques, and applications. Whether you’re looking for a place to start your cloud computing journey, have some experience and are looking to grow, or are an advanced user hoping to learn how TNC can enable you to stay on the cutting edge, this three-part training has a place for everyone.

The training resources provided in this repository will be publicly available beyond the duration of the training. However, access to the S3 bucket used for training purposes will be removed after the last day of training for security purposes. If you would like to replicate the same data workflows, you have two options: 1) instead of reading/writing to the S3 bucket, you can use the local storage (15GB) offered by SageMaker Studio Lab. For this, you will need to replace the lines of code that read/write from/to S3 with a simply read/write to local storage; 2) if you are ready to use AWS SageMaker for your TNC work at scale, please reach out to the [IT Conservation & Geospatial Systems Team](mailto:GSTeam@tnc.org) to get setup on an enteprise TNC account to enjoy full access to our resources.

The training modules are structures as follows:

**Beginner Spatial Data Science**: Learn the basics of getting started with spatial data science and cloud computing at TNC. The tools and resources available, key steps, and strategies to get you going. Instructors: Francesco Tonini (Geospatial Data Scientist, Conservation & Geospatial Systems, IT) and Naomi Provost (Head of Engineering, CTrees).

Feb 3: 11am - 12pm EST
Feb 4: 8pm – 9pm EST
 
**Intermediate Spatial Data Science**: Explore new platforms and techniques for ETL (Extracting, Transforming and Loading), take advantage of open data portals on the cloud, and test new features to advance your work. Instructors: Matt Kenny (Geospatial Data Engineer, Conservation & Geospatial Systems, IT) and an external speaker from Earthmover.

Feb 10: 11am – 12:30pm EST
Feb 11: 8pm – 9:30pm EST
 
**Advanced Spatial Data Science**: Learn to apply advanced end-to-end spatial data science workflows using cloud-native data formats and scalable compute services such as AWS SageMaker to inspire your conservation work at TNC. Instructors: Francesco Tonini (Geospatial Data Scientist, Conservation & Geospatial Systems, IT) and Glenn Moncrieff (Applied Spatial Data Scientist, Global Science).

Feb 24: 11am - 1pm EST
Feb 25: 8pm – 10pm EST

The folders in this github repository will contain all the notebooks and materials presented during each session for you to access beyond the duration of the training. For any questions about this repository and materials, you can reach out to [Zachary Simek](mailto:zachary.simek@tnc.org), [Francesco Tonini](mailto:francesco.tonini@tnc.org), or [Matthew Kenny](mailto:matthew.kenny@tnc.org).
