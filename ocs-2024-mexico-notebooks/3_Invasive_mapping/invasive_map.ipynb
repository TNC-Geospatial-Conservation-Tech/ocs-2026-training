    "We will be using a model called xgboost. There are many, many different kinds of ML models. xgboost is a class of models called gradient boosted trees, related to random forests. When used for classification, random forests work by creating multiple decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the data and features, and then averaging their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. Gradient boosted trees differ in that they build trees sequentially, with each new tree focusing on correcting the errors of the previous ones. This sequential approach allows xgboost to create highly accurate models by iteratively refining predictions and addressing the weaknesses of earlier trees."

This involves handling a large volume of data, so we need to write the code to do this intelligently. We will accomplish this by applying the .predict() method of our trained model in parallel across the chunks of the sentinel 2 xarray. The model will receive one chunk at a time so that the data is not too large, but it will be able to perform this operation in parallel across multiple chunks, and therefore will not take too long.\n",
