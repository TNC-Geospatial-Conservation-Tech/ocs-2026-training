# Spatial Data Science virtual training - Advanced Module

The first step for this Advanced training module is to launch AWS SageMaker Studio Lab (**SMSL** hereafter) by clicking the button below and cloning the entire repository onto that environment. During the cloning process, you will also be asked if you want to install the required packages from the environment.yml file.

**NOTE: Be sure to select ‘clone entire repository’ when prompted. SMSL will also ask if you want to install required packages from environment.yml. Make sure to say YES as this environment YAML file contains all of the required Python packages to complete the training sections in the Jupyter Notebooks.**
