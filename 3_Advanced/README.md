# One Conservancy Science: Data Science training - Feb. 2026
The first step for this Advanced training module is to launch AWS SageMaker Studio Lab (SMSL hereafter) by clicking the button below and cloning the entire repository onto that environment. During the cloning process, you will also be asked if you want to install the required packages from the environment.yml file. This file contains all of the required Python packages to complete the training sections in the Jupyter Notebooks.

**NOTE: Be sure to select ‘clone entire repository’ when prompted. Studio lab will also ask if you want to install required packages from environment.yml.**
