    "Let's start our big data viz journey by using some sample climate datasets in GeoTIFF format, downloaded from the [PRISM online repository](https://prism.oregonstate.edu/downloads/) by Oregon State University. If you are interested in how to programmatically download these data, please refer to [this blog post](https://medium.com/@mahyar.aboutalebi/how-to-download-process-and-visualize-climate-data-in-python-cfd6d8350322). To simplify things, we pre-downloaded the data for this training. In this step, we will read a raster file of the mean air temperature for the CONUS extent for July of 2025, replace -9999 values with NaN, create a mesh grid for latitude and longitude, and set up the titles, x-axis and y-axis labels, and color ramp:"

Lexcube is one of the libraries in this field that helps us visualize data cubes, particularly 3D geospatial databases, quickly and in a visually engaging way. In this post, we cover how to prepare your datasets for this library and how to use it for your data visualization projects. Specifically, we created two datasets: one based on completely random numbers and the second based on air temperature reported by climate databases. Additional sources are provided if you want to create your data cube for any location and time frame."
